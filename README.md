Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals in developing testing and maintaining software.

- Reliability: it ensures that software functions as intended without bias particularly in critical applications.

- Security: it involves implementing protective practices such authorization, encryption and authentication to safeguard user information.

- Scalability and Flexibility: it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.

- Efficiency: it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

- Mastering Complexity: it focuses on managing the increasing complexity of software systems. Techniques like modular programming, object oriented design and obstraction were introduced to break down large systems in manageable components.

- Mastering Process: Emphasis was placed on formalizing the software development process. Methodologies like the Waterfall model, Agile and DevOpswere developed to ensure structured, efficient and iterative workflows.

- Mastering Machine: This milestone highlights advancements in hardware and software integration. It includes optimizing software to leverage evolving hardware capabilities such as multi-core processors and distributed systems for better performance and scalability.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

- Planning - Identify the software requirement or purpose and scope

- Requirement Analysis - Identify the final user specification.

- Design - Building the framework.

- Coding - Converting software design into tangible code.

- Testing - Examine the software for any bugs and glitches.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology - Linear and sequenstial, each phase is completed before moving on.

- There is low flexibility, changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is completed.

- Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.

- Testing is done at the end of the development process.

Agile Methodology - Iterative and incrimental with multiple cycles.

- High flexibility , adapts to changing requirements .

- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint.

- Testing is continuous and done after iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
